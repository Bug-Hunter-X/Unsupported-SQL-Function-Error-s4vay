This repository contains a demonstration of an error caused by using an unsupported function in an SQL query. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version of the query, either using a supported alternative or avoiding the unsupported function altogether.  The error is common when migrating codebases between different database systems or using different database versions, or when utilizing features not natively supported by the underlying database.
