The SQL query uses a function that is not supported by the database system or the version of the database system being used. This can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect results. For example, a function that is available in MySQL 8.0 might not be available in MySQL 5.7.  Another example is attempting to use a JSON function on a database that doesn't support JSON natively. 
```sql
SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(jsonData, '$.name') FROM myTable;
```
This query will fail if the database system does not support the `JSON_EXTRACT` function.
